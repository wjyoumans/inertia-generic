## inertia-generic

**inertia-generic** provides implementations of generic algebraic structures like 
polynomial rings, matrix spaces, and fraction fields which can be recursively 
defined. 

It is part of [inertia](https://github.com/wjyoumans/inertia) 
but is designed to be usable as a standalone crate (alongside 
[inertia-algebra](https://github.com/wjyoumans/inertia-algebra), which provides
traits for algebraic structures).
